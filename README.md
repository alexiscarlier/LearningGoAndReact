# Learning Go And ReactJS

## Overview
The top-level goal for our final two-week project of Makers Academy was to learn a new language. The focus of this goal was learning Go, and we decided to aim towards building a communications app to frame this learning process. To extend our goal of learning new technologies, we decided to write the front-end of the application in ReactJS, a framework which was new to everyone in the group.

This repo is a collection of resources we used to support and document our process of learning Go and ReactJS for our final project.

Its purpose is to:
- Formalize the process of learning new languages to provide a framework for learning languages in the future;
- Record key learning outcomes from exploring Go and ReactJS to be used as a reference-point, during the project and afterwards;
- Enable tight, reflective cycles during the project to guide our learning and maximise our efficiency;
- Leverage the capacity of the group by supporting each others' learning.

## Neighbour.ly

Neighbour.ly is the communications app we aimed towards producing as a means of testing our ability to learn Go and ReactJS from scratch. Click below to find the respective repos for the server and client sides:

## Go Challenges

To begin learning Go, we each completed a series of kata-like exercises to explore features of the language.
